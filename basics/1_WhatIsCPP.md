## What is C++?

In short, C++ is a general-purposed compiled programming language. _General-purposed_ means that the language isn't specialized and can be used for pretty much anything. _Compiled_ means that the program that you write in C++ is converted to machine code, which is stored in a file, before it is ran.

C++ is a very powerful and versatile language, and is used in a majority of desktop applications, embedded devices, and servers. Most other programming languages have their foundations built by either C (a subset of C++ (kind of)) or C++. C++ pretty much forms the very fundamentals of modern computing, whether you like it or not.

The areas in which C++ is used the most are either to create interpreters for other programming languages or to create software that demands either high performance or direct, low-level access to hardware components. One of the most common applications of C++ is in game engines, as game engines demands very high performance and requires access to the graphics card to render frames. Desktop applications are also often written in C++, as they often have to integrate well with the rest of the system, which is often written also in C++.

C++ is currently a very popular language and definitely worth learning. However, C++ can indeed be hard to learn for some people (like Anthony Huang and Neng Li from the Li Institution), which is why C++ programmers are sometimes considered "programming masters".

Anyways, now that you have a basic idea of what C++ is and who uses it, head over to the next chapter to start your C++ journey!
